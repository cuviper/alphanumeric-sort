Alphanumeric Sort
====================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/magiclen/alphanumeric-sort.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/magiclen/alphanumeric-sort)

This crate can help you sort order for files and folders whose names contain numerals.

## Motives and Examples

With the Rust native `sort` method, strings and paths are arranged into lexicographical order. In some cases, it is not so intuitive. For example, there are screen snap shots named by **shot-%N** like **shot-2**, **shot-1**, **shot-11**. After a lexicographical sorting, they will be ordered into **shot-1**, **shot-11**, **shot-2**. However, we would prefer **shot-1**, **shot-2**, **shot-11** mostly.

```rust
let mut names = ["shot-2", "shot-1", "shot-11"];

names.sort();

assert_eq!(["shot-1", "shot-11", "shot-2"], names);
```

Thus, in this kind of case, an alphanumeric sort might come in handy.

```rust
extern crate alphanumeric_sort;

let mut names = ["shot-2", "shot-1", "shot-11"];

alphanumeric_sort::sort_str_slice(&mut names);

assert_eq!(["shot-1", "shot-2", "shot-11"], names);
```

```rust
extern crate alphanumeric_sort;

use std::path::Path;

let mut paths = [Path::new("shot-2"), Path::new("shot-1"), Path::new("shot-11")];

alphanumeric_sort::sort_path_slice(&mut paths);

assert_eq!([Path::new("shot-1"), Path::new("shot-2"), Path::new("shot-11")], paths);
```
